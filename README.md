Welcome to my Gene-Analysis-Python and Data Visualization Analysis repository! This project showcases my ability to filter and visualize important data from larger datasets using various Python modules. 
The data for this analysis was provided by my university professor, and it may include either real-time data or randomly generated data for educational purposes. 
The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate my skills in data visualization, featuring complex codes and detailed plots. 
This project also illustrates the application of data visualization and filtration methods in preparing machine learning models.
